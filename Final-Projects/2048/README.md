# 2048

This is a working, colored version of 2048 in the console, made in C++ (obviously). It's **NOT** cross-platform, since it requires Windows headers to use the arrow keys. My Hangman program is cross-platform, however, since it requires nothing of the sort.

It can save your game, load your game, etc.

You use the arrow keys to control the game.

*(work in progress)*
