# Hangman

This project is a hangman game using colors, like the 2048 game, that reads words from a list in a text file and picks a random one for the user to guess at. You have to press a letter and then press enter, and from there the program will tell you if you are right, if you have already guessed that letter, or if you're wrong. It also prints a nice picture of a man hanging, which serves as the countdown for how many wrong guesses you've taken and have left.
